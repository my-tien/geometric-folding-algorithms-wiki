# Linkage
Created Donnerstag 25 Juli 2024

A *linkage* is a collection of fixed-length 1D segments joined at their endpoints to form a graph. A segment endpoint (graph node) is called a *vertex*. The segments (graph edges) are often called *links* or *bars*, and shared endpoints are called *joints* or *vertices*.
Some joints may be *pinned* to specific locations.

Planar linkage
--------------
A planar linkage is a linkage of one-dimensional segments lying in a plane. The joints permit full 360Â° rotation, and the rigid segments are permitted to pass through one another freely.

Mechanism
---------
 Lose term in the book to refer to any collection of rigid bodies connected by joints, hinges, sliders, etc.
