# Content Classification
Created Sonntag 21 Juli 2024

Possible ways to classify contents of the book:

- by object: 1D linkages, 2D paper, 3D polyhedra
- by process:  folding vs. unfolding, but both are just a reconfiguration between two states
- by problem:
*design problem*: given a specific folded state, design a way to fold to that state
*foldability problem*: can this type of object fold to some general class of folded states?
