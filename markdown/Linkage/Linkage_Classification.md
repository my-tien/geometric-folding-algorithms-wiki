# Linkage Classification
Created Samstag 27 Juli 2024

Linkages can be distinguished according to


* their **graph structure**
	* general graph
	* tree
	* single cycle aka polygon
	* simple path aka (polygonal) chain aka arc/robot arm/arm
* the **dimension** of the ambient space in which the linkage lives
* **intersection conditions**: How may the linkage intersect with itself or with obstacles?
	* No constraints means arbitrary rotations and free passing through itself permitted. In 2D e.g. realized by links at slightly different levels in parallel to a plane connected by orthogonal pegs as joints.
	* If no self-intersection is allowed, the linkage is called *simple* in the literature and the self-intersection constraint is referred to as the demanded *simplicity* of the linkage. Note that there is a distinction between self-intersection and [self-crossing](./self-crossing.md).
