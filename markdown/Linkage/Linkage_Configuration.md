# Linkage Configuration
Created Samstag 27 Juli 2024

Also called a "placement", "confirmation" or "realization" in the literature. "realization" is reserved for a different concept in this book.

A configuration of a linkage is a specification of the locations of all link endpoints (and therefore of the link orientations and joint angles). It respects the lengths and non-self-intersection constraints of the linkage but may penetrate obstacles.

A configuration which avoids all obstacles is said to be *free*, and one that touches but does not penetrate obstacles is *semifree*.

Configuration space
-------------------

The configuration of an *n*-vertex polygon in 3D can be specified by 3*n* numbers: *n* triples of vertex coordinates. The *configuration space* (or *moduli space*) is the space of all configurations of a linkage.
In the polygon example, this space is a subset of 3*n*-dimensional space, ℝ³*^n^*.
