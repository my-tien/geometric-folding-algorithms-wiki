# Unfolding to Net
Created Donnerstag 25 Juli 2024

In the 16th century, Albrecht DÃ¼rer drew many convex polyhedra cut open along edges and unfolded flat to a single non-overlapping piece. This is called a *net*.

Yet unsolved question:

Can the surface of every convex polyhedron be cut along edges and unfolded to a net?

The design target is a planar shape that avoids overlap. If the cuts are not restricted to the edges of the polyhedron, the answer is known to be YES.
